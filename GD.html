<h2> Brief <br> Use Case 1.1</h2>
<h3> Log in </h3>

<br>

<h2> Casual <br> Use Case 1.2</h2>
<h3> Find pokemon </h3>
<p>The player uses the W, A, S, D or arrow keys to move the character around the "game world".<br>
   While the player is moving around the game world they have a chance to find a pokemon in certain sections of the map where there is tall grass.<br>
   When a pokemon is found by the player, a fight initiates. <br> <br>
   If the player's pokemon is dead then they are forced to retreat from battle if a pokemon is found.
